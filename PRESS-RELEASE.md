# Twine #
  > Github for Documents

## TL;DR ##
  > Version control on complex documents is difficult. Twine is an online document editor as simple as Google Docs using the power of Git for version control.

## Overview ##

  > If you've ever collaborated on a large research or legal document, you've undoubtably run into version control challenges. Your changes are accidentally overwritten. Your document is riddled with redlines and comments. You are constantly emailing documents back/forth. Etc. etc. 

  Google Docs or MS Word make large scale document collaborations virtually impossible, and thus some researchers and novelists have turned to GitHub to accomplish this. The technology powering GitHub - "Git", is one of the most widely used version control system in the world today. Git allows a staggering number of software developers to collaborate on complex systems while maintaining a full history of changes.

  While GitHub is awesome for software, it can be terribly confusing for document creation (try teaching a non-engineer how to use the terminal...). That's why we built Twine.

  First and foremost, Twine is a collaboration platform. Easily create open-source documents that can be 'copied' by dozens of collaborators. Each copy becomes a separate branch of the document's tree, allowing users to work on edits to the core document, or take it in a totally new direction. 

  Each collaborator works on their document in isolation from one another, eliminating the need for 'track changes'. When a collaborator is ready to contribute their work to the parent document, they can submit an integration request. The owner of the parent document automatically sees the differences between the two documents and can choose to accept the differences, request changes, or decline them entirely.

  We hope to inspire the many researchers, novelists, and creators around the world via open document collaboration.
